# Skylines-Traffic-Manager 1.1.1
A WIP mod for Cities: Skylines to add additional road traffic control

# Changelog
- Updated codebase to support Cities Skylines 1.1.1 patch. Version number of Mod will now track CS build number to keep it easy.
- Major codebase refactoring and cleanup. Still a long ways to go, but this should make enhancements, and bug fixing easier.

# Current features

- Add/Remove traffic lights
- Add priority signs
- Change lanes
- Add/Remove crosswalks
- Manually control traffic lights
- Timed traffic lights
- Clear traffic
- No despawn

# Known issues

- Crosswalks become permanent upon save/load game
- Crosswalks work on places it shouldn't (like intersections) and the result is missing textures.
- Other minor issues

# Roadmap
