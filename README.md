# Skylines-Traffic-Manager 0.6b
A WIP mod for Cities: Skylines to add additional road traffic control

# Current features

- Add priority signs
- Change lanes
- Add/Remove crosswalks
- Manually control traffic lights
- Timed traffic lights
- Clear traffic
- No despawn

# Known issues

- UI problems using ESC key and some other mildly frustrating issues
- Crosswalks become permanent upon save/load game
- Crosswalks work on places it shouldn't (like intersections) and the result is missing textures.
- Older saves of the same city will not work correctly
- You need to restart the game in case you reload a new/saved game (traffic manager stops loading)
- Other minor issues

# Roadmap

- Road restrictions (speed limit, bus/service/car/cargo lanes)
