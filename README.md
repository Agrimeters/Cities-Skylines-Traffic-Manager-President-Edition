# Skylines-Traffic-Manager
A WIP mod for Cities: Skylines to add additional control for traffic light junctions

# !!!ATTENTION!!!
This mod adds new components to the game which means that maps saved with this mod CANNOT be opened without it!
You don't need to start a new game to use this mod but you should backup your save file beforehand since this is a very early work in progress.

# Objective
The goal of this mod is to add the functionality for manual changing of traffic lights and scripted timing
